# OpenSpace Organizer

## 🏢 Description

Your company moved to a new office at the Gent Zuiderport. Its an openspace with 6 tables of 4 seats. As many of you are new colleagues, you come up with the idea of changing seats everyday and get to know each other better by working side by side with your new colleagues. 

This script runs everyday to re-assign everybody to a new seat.



## 📦 Repo structure - usage

in this MVP, all scripting is done in testing.ipynb
for a succesfull outcome, all coding-blocks (except the ones with comment "testing") should be run sequentially.
